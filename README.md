# AquaCrop Vis

## Motivation
Aquacrop is the crop-water productivity model developed by FAO. Currently, aquacrop produces output txt files that are not easy to process and visualize. We intend to fill that gap by developing a R shiny app that would automatically read the output simulations of aquacrop and produce meaningfull plots and statistics that the user can automatically embed into reports.
